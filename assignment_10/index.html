    <div class="para"><em>Jess</em> was jolted awake while laying upon his bed. He had been startled by the sound of a
        car
        starting up outside
        his house. His Aunt Suzanne had been visiting for the weekend, which was not unusual. <em>Jess</em> sat awake on
        his
        bed, resting his chin on the palm of his hand, thinking about the recurring dream he has been experiencing for a
        long time.</div>
    <br>
    <div class="para">
        Magic, gods, and demons dressed up in fancy clothing. He himself dressed in a silver, gold and black robe. He
        always seemed to be floating around in a world which had buildings that seemed to glow white. Each night the
        dream seemed to be more and more vivid. He soon stood up, placing his feet on the soft red shag carpet and
        walked over to his closet. Upon opening the closet, he grabbed his school uniform, which included a tie, a vest,
        a black collared shirt, and dress pants. <em>Jess</em> had always gone to a private school from kindergarten
        through high
        school. The private schools had unusual rules. He took a deep breath, continuing to think about his dream. It
        seemed real to the point he could recall every detail of the dream to anyone.</div>
    <br>

    <div class="para">About an hour later, he walked out of the front door, after enjoying a delectable breakfast of
        biscuits and
        gravy, he had made for himself. As he rushed down the street towards school he bumped into somebody or
        something. “Sorry.” He said, looking up and seeing that nothing at all was there. What just happened?
        <em>Jess</em>
        thought to himself as he looked around and once again saw that nothing was there. There wasn’t anything that he
        could have bumped into. He stood there for a long moment contemplating what had happened and soon continued to
        walk to school. His heart was beating unusually fast, although that was normal when he was this confused.

    <div class="para"><em>Jess</em> hummed a tune while walking home. It was a bright and sunny day and was absolutely
        beautiful
        out. Since it
        was so nice, he decided to go to the park before heading home. He walked towards the park with a bright smile on
        his face and suddenly heard a voice behind him. <em>"Jess?"</em> The voice said. It was a male voice and it
        seemed oddly
        familiar. <em>Jess</em> turned around and once again saw nothing. “What the hell is going on…?” <em>Jess</em>
        spoke in a confused
        whisper, feeling as if he was losing his mind. As he turned back around he felt someone smack him on the back of
        his head. He heard a voice saying “turn around and look at me damn it.” The voice sounded annoyed. <em>Jess</em>
        once
        again turned around and stared at the air, seeing nothing. “Are you a ghost?” He stuttered in fear. ”No
        <em>Jess</em>, I
        am not a ghost.” The male voice had calmed down a bit. “Gosh, can you really not see me? Do we really have to do
        this the hard way?” The male spoke as a screeching metal sound could be heard. “At least you can hear me. That
        is good, one-second brother.” <em>Jess</em> froze up at the last words that had been spoken to him by the
        mysterious
        voice. Suddenly a medium to deep cut was slashed into the palm of his hand. <em>Jess</em> cried out in pain and
        closed
        his eyes, holding his hand close to his body. <em>Jess</em> then felt a strange feeling like plasma go through
        him which
        made his eyes burn. He stepped back and collapsed on the ground in fear. ”Open your eyes.” The voice spoke in a
        calm friendly tone.</p>
