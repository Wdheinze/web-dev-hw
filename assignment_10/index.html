    <p>Jess was jolted awake while laying upon his bed. He had been startled by the sound of a car starting up outside
        his house. His Aunt Suzanne had been visiting for the weekend, which was not unusual. . Jess sat awake on his
        bed, resting his chin on the palm of his hand, thinking about the recurring dream he has been experiencing for a
        long time.

        Magic, gods, and demons dressed up in fancy clothing. He himself dressed in a silver, gold and black robe. He
        always seemed to be floating around in a world which had buildings that seemed to glow white. Each night the
        dream seemed to be more and more vivid. He soon stood up, placing his feet on the soft red shag carpet and
        walked over to his closet. Upon opening the closet, he grabbed his school uniform, which included a tie, a vest,
        a black collared shirt, and dress pants. Jess had always gone to a private school from kindergarten through high
        school. The private schools had unusual rules. He took a deep breath, continuing to think about his dream. It
        seemed real to the point he could recall every detail of the dream to anyone.

        About an hour later, he walked out of the front door, after enjoying a delectable breakfast of biscuits and
        gravy, he had made for himself. As he rushed down the street towards school he bumped into somebody or
        something. “Sorry.” He said, looking up and seeing that nothing at all was there. What just happened? Jess
        thought to himself as he looked around and once again saw that nothing was there. There wasn’t anything that he
        could have bumped into. He stood there for a long moment contemplating what had happened and soon continued to
        walk to school. His heart was beating unusually fast, although that was normal when he was this confused.

        Jess hummed a tune while walking home. It was a bright and sunny day and was absolutely beautiful out. Since it
        was so nice, he decided to go to the park before heading home. He walked towards the park with a bright smile on
        his face and suddenly heard a voice behind him. “Jess?” The voice said. It was a male voice and it seemed oddly
        familiar. Jess turned around and once again saw nothing. “What the hell is going on…?” Jess spoke in a confused
        whisper, feeling as if he was losing his mind. As he turned back around he felt someone smack him on the back of
        his head. He heard a voice saying “turn around and look at me damn it.” The voice sounded annoyed. Jess once
        again turned around and stared at the air, seeing nothing. “Are you a ghost?” He stuttered in fear. ”No Jess, I
        am not a ghost.” The male voice had calmed down a bit. “Gosh, can you really not see me? Do we really have to do
        this the hard way?” The male spoke as a screeching metal sound could be heard. “At least you can hear me. That
        is good, one-second brother.” Jess froze up at the last words that had been spoken to him by the mysterious
        voice. Suddenly a medium to deep cut was slashed into the palm of his hand. Jess cried out in pain and closed
        his eyes, holding his hand close to his body. Jess then felt a strange feeling like plasma go through him which
        made his eyes burn. He stepped back and collapsed on the ground in fear. ”Open your eyes.” The voice spoke in a
        calm friendly tone.</p>
