1:A system font are fonts that come with the computer system. A webfont is a font that is tuned for use on a website. Web safe fonts arre fonts that are included in most operating systems. 

2: The importance of having fallback fonts or fontstacks is because if a computer does not have the first font that you have provided the css the page will want another font to find. 

3:This assignment went well. I first went to choosing a story that is near to my heart, Two of a Different Kind. A book I wrote myself. After realizing the first chapter was way to long I trimmed the first chapter to 600 words then got to work. Putting in the selectors was fun. Then I messed with css. I chose the font Bebas Neue and Padauk as they look very well together.
