1:The difference btween a div an id and a class? Well an Id is something that is unique. Only one id of one name can be given to only one element. there can not be multiple elements with the same Id. A class on the other hand is different in the way that you can give the same class name to multiple elements. There is divs which are block-line elements and spans are in-line elements. The span element can be used to style texts where-as the the div can help create the layout in css.

2:Alt text is basically the alternative description. Why we use it is for the better use of browsing of the client. It is very good for people who are visually impared to have alt text so they can hear a description of the image that they can not see. It is also very important for Search Engine Optimization.

3:Assignment 7! Halfway through and super hyped. This was also a very fun module as I got to jump into media!.  I really love to now be able to add media to my websites. So cool!. When I first started this project I enjoyed listening to music and getting kinda lost. I then chose a song and went away with coding. I do not think I struggled at any point so this was a very relaxing coding adventure.
