1:I Imagined that My imaginary Client was a company which was a Mother and Son run spa. They asked for something simple yet elegant for their spa, They want to be able to get their spa on the web as they are not getting enough buisness.

2: Display inline allows a user to set a width and height of an element
Display inline block will have the top and bottom margins respected. With Display inline the top and bottom margins are not respected at all. 

3:This was a BLAST!.  When I first looked at this assignment the first thing that came to mind was a spa. I then knew I wanted to make something beautiful. I gathered all the images off of Pexels and Got to work. I really got carried away with making this website something that im proud of. I ended up using position absolute a lot because the images were being weird with just the floating. I think that this is my best project yet ^_^
