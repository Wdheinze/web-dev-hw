# Assignment 2
## Whitney Heinze

 I am taking this class because I hope that someday I will be able to get a good job in the graphic design industry. I think that since web development is in such high demands now adays, this is the perfect class to take.  I enjoy to design and create different things for people. When it comes down to web design I am a bit lacking. I am hoping to learn.

1. How to make a beautiful website for clients
2. How to make a responsive website
3. How to control the size of text on websites
