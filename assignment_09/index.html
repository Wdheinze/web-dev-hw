        <p>The overall look of the ’60s was
        <div class="bigger">clean and open.</div> Modernism and abstract expressionism began to take hold –
        the traditional past was rejected and new trends and points of view were celebrated.<br>
        Most importantly, design became a means of provoking emotion and reaction. Minimalism, as a form of
        Modernism reduced design to only the most essential elements. In contrast, the <div class="bigger">“flower
            power” and Hippie movements</div> were more decorative and ethnic in nature.</p>
