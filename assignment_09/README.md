1:In Designing websites there are a few selectors we can use. My particular favorite is the div tag. Now to the question
 The div tag can only have one thing under its name having more than one thing under the same name selector of div will give you an error. 
 The Universal selector is basically for the whole website. If you put in the font here and size it will go to the rest of the sites styling. Classes on the other hand you can use the same class name multiple times and it will not break the website. I think that this is handy. Element selectors are probaby the most handy where you can select a specific element and style it by itself. Out of all of these I really enjoy using the Div tag.

2:The color pallet I have chosed is from the 1960's it is inspired by nature. I chose:
Antique Red= #872729
Sunrise= #E5C789
Expresso= #302728
and 
New Orleans Blue= #5091AD
(My mother was born in 1961 so I decided to use these colors.)

3:This was super fun! I really love css. To start this off I decided to research a bunch of colors. I then remembered that my mother was born in Nineteen Sixty-Nine. That was perfect. After researeching colors I found a lovely site that had all the information that I wanted. I then got to coding. Out of everything in web design I have always loved Css. Styling is so much fun. Coding the HTML was a breeze.
