   <p>Chūya Nakahara (中原 中也, Nakahara Chūya), born Chūya Kashimura (柏村 中也, Kashimura Chūya), (29 April 1907 – 22 October 1937) was a Japanese poet active during the early Shōwa period. Originally shaped by Dada and other forms of European (mainly French) experimental poetry, he was one of the leading renovators of Japanese poetry. Although he died at the young age of 30, he wrote more than 350 poems throughout his life. Some of them are included in his collections Yagi no Uta ("Goat Songs", 1934) and the posthumously published Arishi Hi no Uta ("Songs of Bygone Days", 1938). Many called him the "Japanese Rimbaud" for his affinities with the French poet whose poems he translated in 1934.</p>
