1: There can only be one head and body element inside of a html page. If there is more than one the browser could get confused. The head element is used for metadata and things that only the developer can see like css pages meta or viewport, there are a few more things that can go into the head elements as well. The body is where the visible things are placed.
2:Structual markup is the markup that shows the big stuff like headings and paragraphs. Semantic is for smaller yet powerful things like bold or italics. it can be used to show where emphasis is in a paragraph. it can also show the meaning of things.
3:Assignment 5! How much fun this was. I enjoyed being able to put together a nice website with a nice photo. I opened up my recipe that has been on my computer for days(how funny right) and I decided to use that. Coding was a breeze. I really loved going into making something really pretty and Lists!! I love the look of the unordered list. Once I was done coding I did some extra research to answer the questions and now im happy and done. This was fun. Cant wait to work on the next one.
