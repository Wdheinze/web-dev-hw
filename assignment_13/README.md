1: I Think that I learned a lot in this class.  I also learned how to use Github better as I never knew I could make more then one project in a repository. 

2:Even though I knew a lot about HTML/CSS coming into this class I have to admit I have never added media to my websites. This will be fun to add to my future projects

3: The finals!:
Web development has always been a calming fun thing for me. With this project I decided to make a nice gallery website for my art. I downloaded my art and then got to work with coding. Following directions I think that this website shows off my skills of Html and Css well.
