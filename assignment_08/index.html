        <h1>Acclimate your bird to your hand.</h1>

        <p>Training
            your bird to step up has many benefits,
            including
            decreasing his fear towards you, establishing your
            authority, and decreasing his territorial behavior. Your bird may not be immediately comfortable with
            stepping up on your hand, so he will need to first get used to your hand. Begin by placing your hand near
            the outside of his cage for about a week, and talking to him in a gentle voice.
            Once your bird is comfortable with the sight of your hand, place your hand in his cage in a slow and
            non-threatening manner. It may take another week before he is comfortable with your hand inside his cage</p>

        <h1>Place a treat in your hand</h1>
        <img src="images/bird2.jpg" width="700px" height="500px"
            alt="A person reaching their treat filled hand out to a bird" title="treats">
        <p>Your bird may be comfortable with your hand inside his cage, but he still may not want to step on it. Entice
            him to come closer with a treat. <b>Reward him</b> with the treat when he steps closer, even if he does not
            actually touch your hand at first.
            It may take several tries before your bird is ready to take the treat from your hand. Be patient with him.
            Spray millet is a great bird treat</p>

        <h1>Hold your index finger like a perch</h1>
        <img src="images/bird3.jpg" width="700px" height="500px"
            alt="A person with thier finger near the bird like a perch" title="holding finger like perch">
        <p>Once your bird is at ease with your hand being inside his cage, position your index finger like a perch
            (finger pointed out). Slowly move your hand closer to your bird. Next, gently press your finger against your
            bird’s lower chest to encourage him to step up onto your finger.
            Use a verbal cue (‘step up’ or ‘up’) as you press your finger against his chest.
            Reward your bird immediately with verbal praise (‘good bird’) and a treat when he steps up onto your finger.
            Your bird may not initially understand that he is supposed to step up onto your hand. If he runs away from
            your hand, entice him to your finger with some spray millet rather than following him around his cage with
            your hand</p>
