1: HTML has always been fun to me. When I was studying it all just clicked together. I think the one thing that I enjoted learning that I have never learned before was the Iframe. 

2: I LOVE CSS When it comes down to cascading style sheets I find myself to get a little bit carried away. I cant wait to learn how to make a website responsive.

3:For this assignment I started out by studying the old and then having fun. When it came down to optimizing my photos for the web my program photoshop had broke and it took quite a few days to get it fixed. Coding the html was a breeze. Then I got really excited when it came down to css. I realized that my styling was getting a bit long so I put the rest of it in a different file I hope thats okay. This was super fun!
